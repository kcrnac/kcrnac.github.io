### Kristijan Crnac
I'm Full-stack .NET developer with over 5 years of professional experience currently working at IBM iX (ecx.io). During past years Iâ€™ve gained a lot of knowledge working on larger projects in bigger companies, but also have experience working in a small dynamic startups. Working remotely with other team members and having online meetings with the client is nothing strange to me. On top of that, I can describe myself as very motivated, persistent and meticulous with strong desire for advancement, technology, and learning in general.

Outside of my usual work I like to read books, play sports - especially football, do side projects for learning purposes and find new ways on how to advance in my career as a software developer. As a person I'm always willing to help others, easy-going and open, but strict in rules.

If you are interested in projects I do in my spare time, feel free to check my <a href="https://github.com/kcrnac" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
